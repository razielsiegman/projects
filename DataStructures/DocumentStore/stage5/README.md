# DocumentStore
Data Structures Semester Project (Spring 2020)

- Document database program built using Maven in five stages throughout the Spring 2020 semester as part of the Data Structures course
- Custom built data structures from scratch or with minimal code such as Hash Table, Stack, Trie, Heap and BTree
- Includes a search engine which manages two-tier RAM and Disk storage using JSON serialization and deserialization
- Converts text to PDF and vice versa
- Most files not ending in "Impl" are the interfaces provided by the professor, ex. Document.java, while files ending in "Impl" are the implementations of those interfaces, ex. DocumentImpl.java
- The class intended for the user to interact with is DocumentStoreImpl.java, and is located in the DocumentStore/src/main/java/edu/yu/cs/com1320/project/stage5/impl folder
